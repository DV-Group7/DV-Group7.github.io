            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p>
                Since 1996, the municipality of Trento has been carrying out surveys of green areas and street trees in
                the city. It is important to specify that the data reported dates back to censuses and surveys carried
                out at different times. The surveys and updates of green areas are being completed and therefore the
                data and gardens reported are still partial or do not entirely correspond to reality.<br><br>

                The dataset contains a variety of information, which can be divided into two macro-categories: the first
                category refers to the physical characteristics of individual trees, such as species, height, crown size
                and position. The second, on the other hand, exploits precise methodologies that use the physical
                characteristics of the tree to estimate secondary information such as carbon dioxide captured, pollution
                removed, energy saved, and money saved.<br><br>

                Our goal is to rework the dataset and develop a series of graphical representations of the data that
                will allow for easier and faster reading of the findings.

            <h3>FIRST ASSIGNMENT</h3>
            <h4>HORIZONTAL BARCHART</h4>
            <p>
                First graph.
                The following “BarChart” shows a ranking of the top 20 most common tree species in the territory and
                their
                corresponding quantity.
                We find on the y-axis the names of the trees sorted in decreasing order by quantity and on the x-axis
                their number.
                It is possible to get additional information about a tree specie by moving the mouse over the
                corresponding bar: a
                text area is then shown with the numerical value of the selected tree's abundance and the average canopy
                size.
            </p>

            <a class="button" href="/graph/graph1.html">Graph I</a>
            <h4>HORIZONTAL STACKED BARCHART</h4>
            <p>
                Second graph.
                The Stacked Bar Chart highlights the total number of trees in each neighborhood.
                In particular, it differentiates for each neighborhood the amounts of trees that belong to the top 5
                most common species
                in the Trento area from the remaining species that are grouped together in a single category.
                We find on the y-axis the names of the neighborhoods and on the x-axis the number of trees.
            </p>
            <a class="button" href="/graph/graph2.html">Graph II</a>
            <h4>HORIZONTAL STACKED BARCHART WITH SMALL MULTIPLE</h4>
            <p>
                Third graph.
                The "Stacked Bar Chart With Small Multiple" graph allows, for each neighborhood, to compare the top 5
                most common tree species
                in the area with all the remaining species (grouped all together in "Others").
                On the y-axis we find the names of the neighborhoods.
            </p>
            <a class="button" href="/graph/graph3.html">Graph III</a>
            <h4>HORIZONTAL STACKED BAR CHART WITH PERCENTAGE</h4>
            <p>
                Fourth graph.
                The "Stacked bar chart 100%" shows the percentage present in each neighborhood of both the trees that
                belong to the top 5 most
                common species in the Trento area and the remaining species that are grouped together in a single
                category.
                We find on the y-axis the names of the neighborhoods while the x-axis shows the percentages.
            </p>
            <a class="button" href="/graph/graph4.html">Graph IV</a>
            <h4>WAFFLE CHARTS</h4>
            <p>
                Fifth graph.
                Multiple "Waffle chart" type graphs are shown, each representing a neighborhood, where only the top 5
                most prevalent tree species
                in the Trento area are considered.
                For each chart, the various species are differentiated according to their percentage, allowing
                comparison of the spread of each
                species in each neighborhood.
