                <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p >
Since 1996, the municipality of Trento has been carrying out surveys of green areas and street trees in the city. It is important to specify that the data reported dates back to censuses and surveys carried out at different times. The surveys and updates of green areas are being completed and therefore the data and gardens reported are still partial or do not entirely correspond to reality.<br><br>

The dataset contains a variety of information, which can be divided into two macro-categories: the first category refers to the physical characteristics of individual trees, such as species, height, crown size and position. The second, on the other hand, exploits precise methodologies that use the physical characteristics of the tree to estimate secondary information such as carbon dioxide captured, pollution removed, energy saved, and money saved.<br><br>

Our goal is to rework the dataset and develop a series of graphical representations of the data that will allow for easier and faster reading of the findings.
