        <p class="mb-0">
            Since 1996, the municipality of Trento has been carrying out surveys of green areas and street trees in
            the city. It is important to specify that the data reported dates back to censuses and surveys carried
            out at different times. The surveys and updates of green areas are being completed and therefore the
            data and gardens reported are still partial or do not entirely correspond to reality.<br><br>
            The dataset contains a variety of information, which can be divided into two macro-categories: the first
            category refers to the physical characteristics of individual trees, such as species, height, crown size
            and position. The second, on the other hand, exploits precise methodologies that use the physical
            characteristics of the tree to estimate secondary information such as carbon dioxide captured, pollution
            removed, energy saved, and money saved.<br><br>
            Our goal is to rework the dataset and develop a series of graphical representations of the data that
            will allow for easier and faster reading of the findings.

        <h4 class="mt-1">HORIZONTAL BARCHART</h4>
        <p>
            The following “Bar Chart” shows a ranking of the top 20 most common tree species in the territory and
            their
            corresponding quantity.
            We find on the y-axis the names of the trees sorted in decreasing order by quantity and on the x-axis
            their number.
            It is possible to get additional information about a tree specie by moving the mouse over the
            corresponding bar: a
            text area is then shown with the numerical value of the selected tree's abundance and the average canopy
            size.

        <h4 class="mt-2">HORIZONTAL STACKED BARCHART</h4>
        <p>
            The "Stacked Bar Chart" highlights the total number of trees in each neighborhood.
            In particular, it differentiates for each neighborhood the amounts of trees that belong to the top 5
            most common species
            in the Trento area from the remaining species that are grouped together in a single category.
            We find on the y-axis the names of the neighborhoods and on the x-axis the number of trees.
        </p>
        <a class="button" href="/first-assignment/graph/graph2.html">Graph II</a>
        <h4 class="mt-2">HORIZONTAL STACKED BARCHART WITH SMALL MULTIPLE</h4>
        <p>
            The "Stacked Bar Chart With Small Multiple" graph allows, for each neighborhood, to compare the top 5
            most common tree species
            in the area with all the remaining species (grouped all together in "Others").
            On the y-axis we find the names of the neighborhoods.
        </p>
        <a class="button" href="/first-assignment/graph/graph3.html">Graph III</a>
        <h4 class="mt-2">HORIZONTAL STACKED BAR CHART WITH PERCENTAGE</h4>
        <p>
            The "Stacked Bar Chart 100%" shows the percentage present in each neighborhood of both the trees that
            belong to the top 5 most
            common species in the Trento area and the remaining species that are grouped together in a single
            category.
            We find on the y-axis the names of the neighborhoods while the x-axis shows the percentages.

        <h4 class="mt-2">WAFFLE CHARTS</h4>
        <p>
            Multiple "Waffle Chart" type graphs are shown, each representing a neighborhood, where only the top 5
            most prevalent tree species
            in the Trento area are considered.
            For each chart, the various species are differentiated according to their percentage, allowing
            comparison of the spread of each
            species in each neighborhood.

        <h4 class="mt-1">HISTOGRAM</h4>
        <p>
            The “Histogram” is a graph that is used to represent the distribution of a dataset, that is the frequency
            with which values fall in intervals. In this case trees' height are related to the number of trees that
            possess that height.
            On the x-axis we find the height of the various trees and on the y-axis we find an integer value
            representing the number of trees.
        </p>
        <a class="button" href="/second-assignment/graph/graph1.html">Graph I</a>
        <h4 class="mt-2">BOXPLOT</h4>
        <p>
            A BoxPlot is a method for graphically demonstrating the locality, spread and skewness groups of
            numerical data through their quartiles. In this case, the BoxPlot shows data of the trees' height.
        </p>
        <a class="button" href="/second-assignment/graph/graph2.html">Graph II</a>
        <h4 class="mt-2">SCATTER PLOT</h4>
        <p>
            A “Scatter Plot” is a type of plot or mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for
            typically two variables for a set of data. In this specific case, on
            the x-axis we have the sizes of all the different trees in Trento, whereas on the y-axis we have the amount
            of C02 absorbed by each tree.
        </p>
        <a class="button" href="/second-assignment/graph/graph3.html">Graph III</a>
        <h4 class="mt-2">SCATTER PLOT SMALL MULTIPLE</h4>
        <p>
            Considering only the top 6 most populated tree types in Trento, 6 different scatter plots are displayed,
            each one representing a different tree. Each plot is constructed in the following way: On the x-axis we
            have all the sizes of the considered tree type, whereas on the y-axis we have the amount of C02 absorbed by
            each tree of the specific tree type.
        </p>
        <a class="button" href="/second-assignment/graph/graph4.html">Graph IV</a>
        <h4 class="mt-2">BUBBLE CHART</h4>
        <p>
            The "Bubble Chart" is a type of graph in which each entity represented is defined in terms of three distinct
            numerical parameters so that they can be compared according to their size and location.
            We find on the x-axis the tree size, on the y-axis the CO2 and at the end the bubble size represents the
            canopy size.
